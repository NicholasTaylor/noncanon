# noncanon
This is just a simple Bash script in case you're spinning up a new Linux machine. Inspired by Michael Bazzell. It's designed to harden your system in a few simple ways.
  
This has been tested on instances of the below distros and versions. It is only designed for systems using GNOME as the GUI. As always read the code first and proceed at your own risk before running a Shell script someone else wrote. I'm responsible for nothing.

Tested on:
* Ubuntu
  - 22.04 (Jammy)
* Fedora
  - 37
## Steps
```
git clone git@github.com:NicholasTaylor/noncanon.git
cd noncanon
chmod +x noncanon.sh
/bin/bash noncanon.sh
```
Then enter password when prompted by sudo.
