# noncanon
This is just a simple Bash script in case you're spinning up a new Linux machine. Inspired by Michael Bazzell. It's designed to harden your system in a few simple ways.

This has been tested on instances of the following, but as always read the code first and proceed at your own risk. I'm responsible for nothing:
* Ubuntu
 * 22.04 (Jammy)
* Fedora
 * 37

## Steps
```
git clone git@github.com:NicholasTaylor/noncanon.git
cd noncanon
chmod +x noncanon.sh
./noncanon.sh
```
Then enter password when prompted by sudo.
